    <h1>Televisions and Energy Use (Australia)</h1>
    <p>
      Televisions use electricity mainly based on screen size, brightness settings, and the display technology
      (e.g., LED vs OLED). In the Australian market, checking energy labels and adjusting settings can help reduce power use.

    <h2>Televisions Currently Available in Australia</h2>
    <p>
      The chart below summarises the number of televisions currently available in the Australian market,
      grouped by screen technology. This analysis is based on products marked as available in Australia
      after removing duplicate and outdated submissions.

    <ul>
      <li>Smaller screens generally use less energy than larger screens.</li>
      <li>High brightness can increase energy consumption.</li>
      <li>Standby power can add up if devices are left plugged in.</li>
    </ul>

      This section currently displays a preview of the cleaned television energy dataset used in this project.
      In later tasks, this data will be used to generate interactive visualisations showing power consumption trends.

    <h1>About the data</h1>
    <p>
      This website presents a short data story about televisions currently available in Australia, focusing on what
      screen technologies, screen sizes, and brands are most common in the dataset.
    </p>

    <section class="card">
    <h2>Data source</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset was downloaded from the Australian Government Energy Rating product comparator website
        (Televisions category):
        <a href="https://reg.energyrating.gov.au/comparator/product_types/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          https://reg.energyrating.gov.au/comparator/product_types/
        </a>.
        The data is provided in CSV format and contains product-level information used for comparison.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Data processing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Imported:</strong> Loaded the CSV into KNIME using a CSV Reader node.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtered:</strong> Kept records for Australia and limited the analysis to currently available models.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleaned:</strong> Checked missing values and removed duplicates (keeping the most recent submission where duplicates existed).</li>
        <li><strong>Standardised:</strong> Cleaned brand names to reduce case/spacing/punctuation variations and mapped known variants to one brand name where needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Transformed:</strong> Created screen-size categories (in inches) to support comparisons across common size groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated:</strong> Built summary tables for the charts (counts by technology, size category, and distinct models by brand).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset contains product specification information only (e.g., model identifiers and technical attributes).
        It does not include personal data, customer records, or any user-tracking information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Accuracy and limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The dataset is a <strong>snapshot</strong> of products recorded at the time of download and may not reflect current
          retailer stock levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some categories may appear under multiple labels (for example, <strong>LCD</strong> vs <strong>LCD (LED)</strong>),
          which can affect category counts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brand names can appear in multiple formats; standardisation reduces this issue, but some ambiguity may remain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Counts represent the number of product entries/models in the dataset, not sales volume or consumer popularity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Ethics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Findings are presented as patterns in the dataset, not guarantees about every individual model.
        </li>
        <li>
          The website avoids unfair “best/worst brand” claims without controlling for factors such as screen size and technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limitations are stated clearly to reduce the risk of misleading interpretation.
        </li>
      </ul>

# Appliance Energy Consumption Website – Exercise 0.2

## Overview
This repository contains a small demonstration website developed for **Exercise 0.2** of COS30045.  
The purpose of this website is to demonstrate basic web development skills using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, as well as the use of **GitHub for version control** and **GitHub Pages for hosting**.

The website includes three pages:
- Home
- Televisions
- About Us

Navigation between pages is handled using JavaScript, and consistent styling is applied using an external CSS file.

## Use of Generative AI (GenAI) Declaration

Generative AI tools were used **at an early stage of development** to assist with:
- Generating an initial **basic website structure**
- Providing example boilerplate code for **HTML layout**, **CSS styling**, and **simple JavaScript navigation logic**

After this initial assistance:
- I **reviewed and studied all generated code**
- I **modified, refined, and customised** the structure, styling, and behaviour to better match the task requirements and my own understanding
- Additional changes were made manually, including content edits, layout adjustments, styling refinements, and integration of dataset-related placeholder content

All final code in this repository has been **understood, edited, and tested by me**, and I am able to explain how each part of the website functions.

## Hosting
The website is hosted using **GitHub Pages**, as instructed by the tutor.
